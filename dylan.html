<h1>GREETINGS HUMANS</h1>
<p>I am Dylan (or NeosChampionX, depending on where you may know me from), your average, everyday, friendly person. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what- Wait, no, wrong line.</p>
<p>I like playing League of Legends, a Yu-Gi-Oh player, proficient in Javascript, and a fan of the Touhou Project. I do like keeping to myself sometimes, but I am good at talking to people. </p>
